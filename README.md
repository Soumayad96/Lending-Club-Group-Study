## General Information
- When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
>> 1. Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:<br>
    1. Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)<br>
    2. Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.<br>
    3. Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan.<br>
>> 2. Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.).<br>


- Business Objectives :
>> 1. Identity the risk of the loan applications
>> 2. Indentify the driving factors or variables for the loan application.

- Data to be analyzed
>> Lending Club dataset provided which contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
